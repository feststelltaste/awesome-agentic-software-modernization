# Awesome Agentic Software Modernization [![Awesome](https://awesome.re/badge-flat2.svg)](https://awesome.re)

A curated collection of resources exploring how agentic AI systems can assist in modernizing legacy software: from understanding and refactoring codebases to guiding large-scale transformations.

## What is Agentic Software Modernization?

Agentic software modernization combines:
- **Autonomous AI agents** that can plan, act, and reflect
- **Software Analytics** for deep system understanding that goes beyond just code
- **Refactoring and migration strategies** for long-term evolution of systems

The goal is to help human experts with intelligent agents that can explore, analyze, and improve legacy systems.

## Resources

*Resources within each category are sorted alphabetically by the name of the tools or by the first authors' surname.*

**Hint: This list is a work in progress. Please don't link to the sections, as they may change soon. The summaries will also be revised over time, since most of them were generated by Claude Sonnet and still lack a personal recommender touch (which makes an awesome list really awesome).**
